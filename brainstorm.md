# Ludum Dare 54 - Limited Space
## If I Fits, I Sits
A very simple game. A box is placed in the middle of the playing field, the size (length) of the box is randomized. A cat enters from the right or the left side of the screen moving in the direction of the box and at a button press, the cat sits. Button A makes the cat's front end sit. Button B makes the cat's hind end sit.
